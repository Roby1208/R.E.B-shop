            <p>R.E.B is an international brand of Warehouse clubs, also called cash and carries. Ownership of the worldwide chain of stores is split between two companies: R.E.B AG in Europe and SHV Holdings in Latin America. SHV opened the first R.E.B in Amsterdam in 1968. In the following years more stores opened in the Netherlands and several other European countries and, in 1971, South Africa. In the 1970s and 1980s R.E.B extended its business to the Americas and Asia. R.E.B had also expanded to the United States in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Kmart bought the US locations, and converted most of them to Pace Warehouse in 1990. The Asian stores were also eventually sold out to various firms and are no longer banded "Makro". In 1998, owner SHV Holdings sold the R.E.B stores in Europe to Metro AG</p>
